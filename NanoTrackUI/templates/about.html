  <h2 class="section-title">About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>NanoTrack</strong> is a real-time small object detection and tracking interface 
    optimized for edge devices such as the Jetson Orin NX. 
    The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how modern computer vision models 
    (e.g. EdgeYOLO, Norfair, ByteTrack) can be integrated into an accessible, 
    easy-to-use tool for research and educational purposes.
